## My explanation on markdown
Markdown is very simple and easy to understand.

All you need to know to start using markdown is the symbols that you use to make things appear or act in a certain way.
Like for instance 1 # makes a sentence into the header but there are alot more things you can do like using * to italitize a sentence.
*Just like this sentence* Or just like the 2nd heading which you can make with ## 

you can even cross out things ~~just like this~~ by surrounding a sentence with ~~

spacing in markdown does matter if you don't space things out they look bunched up like a single paragraph so you gotta watch the spacing when doing markdown.

Markdown is simple but if you don't know what symbols do but those are pretty easy to remember after awhile so all you have to do is spend time remembering them.

But most importantly you have to remember to keep markdown organized and controlled or your website will look messy and unorganized.
