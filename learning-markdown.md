Markdown is very simple and easy to understand.

All you need to know to start using markdown is the symbols that you use to make things appear or act in a certain way.
Like for instance 1 # makes a sentence into the header but there are alot more things you can do like using * to italitize a sentence
*Just like this sentence*

you can even cross out things 
~~just like this~~

spacing in markdown does matter if you don't space things out they look bunched up like a single paragraph
so you gotta watch the spacing when doing markdown
