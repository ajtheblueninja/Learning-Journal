## Javascript and Jquery

Javascript is actually quite easy to code and remember when you break it down to the basics, all you must remember is that you use variables and conditions. It can add cool features to your html projects. 

## About Javascript and Jquery

When using Javascript and Jquery you must make sure to use commands in the html like *script* to be able to use the javascript files that you use in your html projects also when using that element you must use the src element as well to tell the code where that javascript file is, like a gps but alot less efficent and manual.

## More About Javascript

Javascript like many other coding language has variables that you can use to your advantage. Variables are a name for a stored concept wheither it be a name, number, or something else like that, they can be automatically set by code or manually set by a user.  You can declare them using the Var element, and they are assingned with a = after the name of the variable where then you put the things that variable equals and then a semicolon. Also if a variable has no assigned variable then its considered undefined as in not completed or not having a value yet.

## Variables Types and storing data

Variables have many types of data, *Nummeric* which deals with numbers like 4, .05, or even -45, basically they are any number. *String* variables are for words or sentences like "Hi", "How are you?", or "Have a nice day!". Finally' there are boolean data types which are really easy, its a true or false statement like if the value of if a variable is a certain value or higher.

Storing data using variables is prety easy all you have to do is use a variable to keep track of a amount or value. However you can also store words and not just numbers which is really handy when you need to keep track of a sentence or word that a user gives. You also can store booleans as well but thats pretty easy as all your saying is if a certain condition is matched then the varable equals true if it doesn't then its false. 

## Shorthand with variables

Now you can use something called shorthand with variables where you shorten the amount of code visable but it still does the entirely same purpose which is a useful short cut for getting things done faster.

## Reasigning variables values

Variables can get their values reasigned quite easily. All thats required is to use the variables name and an equals sign with the new amount or new word, or condition. It saves alot of time because you don't have to rewrite the entire var line of code again, instead you just have to tell it its new value that its storing.
