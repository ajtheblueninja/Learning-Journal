## How Computers Work

All computers can do the following 4 functions. *Input* or be able to get data, *Storage* the ability to store the data thats gotten from the input, *Processing* when the computer processes whats stored on the computer and *Output* or push out the info thats the computer has processed.

## Types of imput

imput devices are things that you use to tell the computer what to do like a mouse, keyboard, or even a webcam. They provide input to give the computer commands which is how you interact with the computer. Even touch screens are a input device because its giving information to the computer.

## Storage and Processing

Storage and Processing is used to store and then process those inputs that are gotten from the input devices and then finally after all of it is done with the processing it gets turned into output which is then used to other forms of media like videos, audio, or input with other applications.

## Computers and Binary

Binary is the way that a computer functions using electricty and switches. Binary works off ot he premise of if it has electricty its a 1 and if not its a 0, thats where people get the idea that a pc's code is made out of 1's and 0's. Things like images, videos, and graphics are made up of a thing called pixels which is made up of 3 color vales known as rgb values. Those values are 3 main colors. Blue, Green, and Red are the colors used in the rgb values to make all the colors possible. And audio is created using sound waveforms which is a series of numbers that determine the color.

## Circuits and logic

Circuits in a computer can take inputs like keystrokes or audio and can store and process them to become an audio file. To do that though it requires million of tiny connections to broadcast or send signals to and between other connections to process the inputs given. Those connections are called gates and they can be very complicated to very simple, the most complicated ones are called logic gates and handles alot of the complex processes that the computer does, but different electrical circuits are used to do different things to make the computer run faster and more effiecently.

## Computer Components

As you know that their are the 4 functions that every computer can do but did you know every computer also has a part that does one of the four jobs. Like input devices, cpu, memory, and your screen. Now the process that it takes to do something like typing the letter B is suprisingly complicated when you stop and think about it. You must press the leter B, the input is given to the pc its stored, processed and then translated into code that can then be turned into pixels and then is outputted to the screen to display a B. Output devices can control external devices like machines.

## Hardware and Software

*Hardware* is the physical compents that make up your pc. *software* is the applications that run on the pc, it tells the pc what to do.
