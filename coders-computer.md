# The Coders Computer

## About the programs

The programs that I installed on my laptop. The programs where node.js, nmp, unbunto,terminal, eslint,and tree. Were used to write and edit code. They all connect together via the program ubuntu which is run off linux but can still be run on a windows computer due to the newest windows 10 update. There are different ways to find stuff on your computer which is part of a stoarge system called directories. tree can help you investigate those directories, unbuntu is used to help the other programs work together and to edit code, terminal is a way to run simple commands to do things like get information or download things, and eslint is a handy dandy tool that lets you fix errors in java script.
there are so many cool programs that you can run to write and edit code like notepad, microsoft visual studio, and even unbunto.

The coding programs all work together in order to allow a programmer to work on and make programs if one thing isnt right then it may cause errors somewhere else and that can lead to a ton of headache and pain.

## Basic Navigation
- Now you can use alot of things like the command tree to find out directies, use the the pwd command in unbuntu to see what root file your on
- you use the cd command to change the root file your on
- and dont forget about ls to to list the current directory your on, ls stands for list btw
-and thats why ls -l displays a long list of content cuz its a part of list but for listing bigger things
-use file[path] to find out what path/directory a certain file is part of
-the file command can tell you what type of file something is
- the command ls -a is used to show all the contents of a directory including hidden files which can be hidden if the file name start with a .
 and thats all I learned about the coder's computer
