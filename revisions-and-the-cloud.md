# Revisions and the Cloud

You can use Ubuntu to make editions/revisions to your github repository Using commands like *git copy* you can copy your repository from github, now remember that git and github are completely different things, but they work together.

*Git push* and *Git add* are two other commands you use in unbuntu with git to add changes to the master file of the repository, and push is to make all the additions and changes perminent.

And you can use commands like *git remote -v* to see where the repository was fetched from and where its pushing the code

The coolest part of all these commands is together you can use the repository from github in programs like visual code editor, or other code editors allowing you to have alot of cool extentions or add ons to make things alot easier.

This system makes sure your code works first before you finalize it so that if something breaks you dont break the entire thing, and its done with a localized copy which you can revert to previous versions.
